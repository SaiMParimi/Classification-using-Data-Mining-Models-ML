# Classification-using-Data-Mining-Models-ML
Machine Learning

•	This application is used for identifying  at-risk  students  based  on  their  academic performance and other pertinent data. Performed data cleaning using Python.
•	GUI application is developed using JAVA Swings, where the numerical data obtained from the database (MS ACCESS) is clustered using K-means algorithm. Naïve Bayesian classification was used to get generalized rules for classifying students into At-risk and Not At-risk categories and predicting classes of future instance.
